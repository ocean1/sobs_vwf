# Star Ocean Blue Sphere Variable Width Font hack

    Star Ocean: Blue Sphere © ENIX © tri-Ace

This code has been bit-rotting in my HDDs for too many years, guess I'm too lazy
to ever complete this project (and it's non-trivial to fit all of the other routines
in an already quite packed  ROM...).

Therefore there you go, enjoy the source code for my vwf hack on SO-BS.
Hope it's gonna be useful for the rom hackers out there.

Use wla-dx to assemble and patch the rom (a84fe6ba0235f4fdc78171693c8bf2458976b07f1a51c39b2a1eb4b39e92bc14).
Should the code look very weird and not straightforward, it was one of my first programming projects, and
I tried to squeeze every single cycle I could out of the routine :)
